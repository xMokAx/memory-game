## How it Works
A simple matching game with 16 cards.

### when the game starts:
* A timer start counting and stops when you finish.
* You have a counter for your moves.
* You start the game with 3 stars and you lose the first star on 11 moves and the second on 15 moves and the third on 20 moves.
* You can restart the game from the restart button.
* When you win you see a summary screen showing time needed to finish, number of moves, number of stars and a play again button to restart the game.
